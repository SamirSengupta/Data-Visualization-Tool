# Data-Visualization-Tool
This code is a data visualization tool that allows the user to upload a CSV file and select a type of plot (line, bar, scatter, or histogram) to visualize the data. It uses the Streamlit library to build a simple user interface and the Matplotlib library to generate the plots.
